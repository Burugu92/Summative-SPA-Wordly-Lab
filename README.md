# Summative SPA – Wordly Dictionary

**Wordly** is a Single Page Application (SPA) dictionary built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to search for words, view definitions, synonyms, pronunciation, and listen to audio — all without refreshing the page.

This project demonstrates modern web development practices, including **API integration, dynamic DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design**.
